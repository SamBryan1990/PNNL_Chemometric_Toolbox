function [C_pls, B_pls] = pnnl_pls(A_train, C_train, A_unknown, r, meanCentered)
    %pnnl_pls Partial least squares (PLS) regression
    %
    %   [C_pls, B_pls] = pnnl_pls(A_train, C_train, A_unknown, r) returns
    %   concentration matrix C_pls computed using the weights and loadings
    %   from the SIMPLS algorithm on mean-centered A_train and C_train.
    %   The relationship between multiplier matrix B_pls and C_pls is
    %   C_pls = (A_unknown - mean(A_train,1)) * B_pls + mean(C_train,1).
    %
    %   pnnl_pls(A_train, C_train, A_unknown, r, meanCentered) applies mean
    %   centering when meanCentered is true, and does not apply mean
    %   centering when meanCentered is false.  When meanCentered is not
    %   supplied, the default is false (no mean centering).
    %
    %   Example:
    %
    %     load pnnl_napalm_data
    %     r = 3;
    %     meanCentered = true;
    %     [C_pls, B_pls] = pnnl_pls(A_train, C_train, ...
    %                               A_unknown, r, meanCentered);
