    %pnnl_cls Classical least squares (CLS) regression
    %
    %   [C_cls, B_cls, K_cls] = pnnl_cls(A_train, C_train, A_unknown)
    %   returns concentration matrix C_cls, the least-squares solution that
    %   minimizes norm(C_cls*K_cls - A_unknown), of the Beer's law
    %   relationship CK=A.  Extinction coefficient matrix K_cls is the
    %   least-squares solution that minimizes norm(C_train*K - A_train)
    %   where A_train is a matrix of training spectra corresponding to
    %   known concentrations in the C_train matrix.  Multiplier matrix
    %   B_cls is the pseudo-inverse of Beer's law extinction coefficient
    %   matrix K_cls such that C_cls = A_unknown * B_cls.

    %   Example:
    %
    %     load pnnl_napalm_data
    %     [C_cls, B_cls, K_cls] = pnnl_cls(A_train, C_train, A_unknown);
